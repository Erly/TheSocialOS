The Social OS
===================

The Social OS let you manage your cloud files as if you were just using local 
files on your normal desktop. You can also manage your accounts in multiple 
social networks and talk with friends thanks to a chat. The webapp is done 
with [Google Web Toolkit][gwt].

We believe that:

- The web is the future.
- There is a big chaos with so many cloud services and some order is needed, The
  Social OS gives us this order in our social life.
- Working in open source is the way to go.


Future
-------

This project (the [Google Web Toolkit][gwt] version) is discontinued so feel 
free to fork it and work on it if you feel like it. This code is now being ported to 
[Dart][d], because we think it's a cleaner solution than GWT and it's a technology 
with a brilliant future that lets us use future technologies like [Web Components][wc] NOW.
